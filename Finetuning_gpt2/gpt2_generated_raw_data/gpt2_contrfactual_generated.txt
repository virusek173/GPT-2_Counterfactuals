A man had been shot and killed in Oakland, California, and now the suspect in the crime has been identified as the suspect in the attack, authorities said.

As an example, a man's body was found in the street around 6:40 a.m. Thursday, near the site of the shooting.

The woman has died.

"There have been four cases in which firearms have been recovered in the area," said Teresa Halbach, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Justice's Office of the Inspector General. "We have no information yet on any arrests, and we have no evidence that any criminal charges will be pressed."

The man who came into the scene was identified as 52-year-old James Kagan, who was arrested on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, possession of a weapon that could reasonably be expected to cause injury, or use of a weapon intended to cause serious injury.

The man, who police said was not a known criminal, was shot in the head on Oct. 2, according to officers.

The National Rifle Association said in a statement that it was "deeply saddened" by the deaths and that it would seek the services of anyone who may have been responsible for the deaths of two people, including the shooter, in their home.

Harris County Sheriff's Office said it was not aware of any other injuries.

"If I had known I would be in the hospital I would have immediately died," said David Duke, a Republican strategist who did not want to be named. "If I had known I would be here today, I would have been in jail in the last year of my life."

The gunman, whose name has not been released, faces several charges including first-degree murder, first-degree assault and first-degree kidnapping.

No one was injured in the shooting.

The victim was taken to a hospital with non-life threatening injuries, the FBI said.

"I'm not a lawyer," the victim said, according to the Associated Press. "I just want to have a good time because I love them."

Attorney John Heise said at the time that he had raised the case with his wife and son.

"We have been hopeful that there would be no further delay in the outcome of the case, and that he would have had the final say," he said.

The shooting occurred on the third, third anniversary of the shootings.

Around 9 a.m., police said the suspect's gun had the capacity of a semi-automatic rifle, which is one of the weapons that's currently disassembled and stored in a vault in a city in northern California.

The gunman was able to fire through a window, which I thought was a good thing, but when I reached for it, I was distracted by my phone and was struck by the sound of the gunfire, according to police.

The victim had initially told police earlier that he had only been shot at gunpoint as a child, but when the man was shot at point blank range, he felt the gun was there to stop him.

"My husband and I were in the back of his car when he was shot," said his wife, Susan the director of the Greater San Francisco Center for the Study of Religion and Human Rights. "He could not have been spared. He could have died."

The mother, who is in her 30s, said she was traveling with her son when the shooter opened fire.

"He could have pulled out one of those revolvers," she said. "You know what I mean? If he had ever had a chance, I would have fired him."

The gunman, who was not identified, was a former Navy SEAL who had served in the United States military, according to the Army. He was operating under a license from the military, and had been at work when he was killed, according to the military.

The gunman had been living in a home near where he was shot, but could have gotten out of the house by having been standing in a doorway with his hands in his pockets.

The father, who did not wish to be named, said the family would be in shock if they hadn't seen the video.

"I just want to know what's going on in the world. And it's not like I have anything to worry about," the father said. "I don't know how I could say I would have been happier if I had been poor, or if I had some other resources to help me go about my life at a better level."

The mother said she had not received a payment for the three-year-old's care and that she would have preferred that she had been able to pay for her son's treatment, but that she had not been able to.

"He was in no way breaking any laws," she said. "I really hope that.
