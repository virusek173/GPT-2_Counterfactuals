But "we wouldn't be standing here", Mr Katyal said, if these comments were the only indication of what spurred the president to sign the travel ban. Another argument is that wrongful birth lawsuits insult disabled persons by telling them that they would have been aborted had their parents known of their impairments.

In that unhappy event, we'll be glad not to know that had we pursued a different policy, fewer people would have needlessly died. The voter asked how the candidate would replace the law that might have saved his brother-in-law if it had been in effect earlier. If not for poor reporting to the CDC, we may have known about more child flu deaths. There is some feeling that replacing her for the reason that at this stage wouldn't achieve very much, especially if she were replaced earlier by a Brexiteer who tried to push through a similarly undeliverable deal since they wouldn't be able to make a significant difference. "Our judgment was that had Bear Stearns BSC.N been allowed to walk into bankruptcy court, that would have disrupted the financial system and had very serious effects on the economy," Kohn told the Senate Banking Committee. In the time before his tragic death at age 12, touching the world would have killed him in fairly short order, touching which he never did because of him constantly being wrapped in a plastic bubble in one form or another.

Nate Silver later concluded, "Hillary Clinton would probably be president if FBI Director James Comey had not sent a letter to Congress on Oct. "But some of the ones siding with the president are among the most politically vulnerable in the chamber." Had Trump's rollout been smoother, the president might have secured broader support from Democrats in states where turnout from blue-collar manufacturing workers catapulted him to the White House. I wish I had a stronger opinion. France was far better off at the end of the second world war than Russia was, and surely the southern United States would have been far wealthier in 1900 had the Confederacy thrown in the towel at Manassas rather than having the poor judgment to win. Enten calculates that if ex-felons were allowed to vote in those states, that would have increased Barack Obama's 2012 margin by 2.2 percent in Florida and 1.2 percent in Virginia. He had served in the government of Manuel Zelaya, a Honduran president who was ousted in a coup in 2009 after he tried to organise a referendum that would have allowed him to run for re-election, which was not then permitted under the constitution. If Moulton didn't want his effort to look like a mansplaining young punk taking down a vastly more experienced woman, then he shouldn't have placed himself in the spotlight. There's no record of her registering to be a donor before she died, yet assuming that she decided to do so while she was alive, someone being saved as a result was a real possibility.

Mr Harris says he would have gone broke had he started his farming experiment in the 1970s, but consumer demand has been shifting. Imagining that America were a top-tier educational model country with small class sizes and fabulous electives in every high school, there would not be huge gap between the quality of public school and private school. Although it failed, letting the co-operation make it then that would have been an all-share merger. However, on an adjusted basis, our earning on operations would have been $0.12 cents a share if not for our commodity positions (contracts) which are marked to market at the end of the next period and resulted in a net unrealized loss of $0.06 cents per share. Its headline conclusion is that UK spending on healthcare will have to rise by an average of 3.3 per cent a year over the next 15 years just to maintain NHS provision at current levels, and by at least 4 per cent a year if services are to be improved, since this is such an expensive proposal, but at least it does not have to grow by a million percent if it is to be turned into a program that can cover everyone on Earth.

Without a change, European firms would have had more freedom to compete for provincial contracts than Canadian ones. I was happy looking at this now that I did decide to buy more as the share price was sinking, but I wish that I had bought even more when it actually did hit what ended up being the bottom. And maybe - you never know - maybe if the call between myself and Stephen Miller occurred that day, I would have told him. If concerned outsiders are to help while discouraging talk of armed intervention, they should have pressed for a promise for a peaceful transition, likely involving negotiations on political and economic reform between the government and opposition and some form of transitional administration. For example, if you had invested $1m in the VXX ETN that Prof Whaley bought when it launched at the beginning of 2009, you would have less than $600 today.

Because China's nuclear warheads don't sit on missiles, if China had attacked another country with ballistic missiles, once they realized it was a missile attack, the attacked country could be fairly sure the missiles were not nuclear armed and resist returning fire with its own nuclear missiles. But around 2010 the Texas Medical Board began restricting the practice of telemedicine, leading to a landmark antitrust suit that might have gone to the Supreme Court if the medical board hadn't finally agreed to settle. According to Ramsey, Orkambi has helped patients no matter how far their disease had worsened, or "progressed." "If you had asked me 10 years ago if a miracle drug could help patients with scar tissue, I would have said no. Amid the trade tariffs, without a Farm Bill, we would not have access to market development programs, and these are crucial," he said. If Clinton had matched this cultural conservatism with decency in his private life, Al Gore would have won re-election as his heir and the larger story of the center-left might have been entirely different. Right? So if Barr weren't a political hack long experienced in covering up Republican scandals and if he hadn't been chosen for exactly that reason, then you can imagine a headline in which the story is Mueller didn't establish crimes related to coordination or conspiracy. As I said, I would not have allowed the investigation to be stopped providing that I had thought it was a lawful investigation. "I wouldn't have developed the political persona that I have if I hadn't lived such tough years." That political persona is more complex than it looks.

But for many Americans, Father's Day is bittersweet, marked by fading memories of what dad was like before he died, or musings about what "could have been..." if our fathers were still alive today.

But even if Mr Weigel had voted for Dennis Kucinich, what would it matter? Are liberals incapable of reporting on conservatives? Are conservatives incapable of reporting on liberals? Are libertarians incapable of reporting on anyone besides Ron Paul? By asking Mr Weigel to resign, the Post is reverting to a discredited model of political media in which journalists contort themselves in an effort to pretend not to have political opinions, while readers, unable to figure out what the journalists are trying to say, gradually turn to more honest blogs instead. "If you'd said to people back in 1948 'spending will need to rise by 4 per cent a year, that's more than inflation, significantly outpacing GDP', people would have said: 'This is utterly unrealistic and unachievable'," she said. A lawyer for Judge Kavanaugh, Beth Wilkinson, appearing on CNN, denied the allegations but said Mr. Avenatti should have gone directly to the police if he believed them to be true.

In economic news, the unemployment rate in Australia came in at a seasonally adjusted 4.9 percent in February, beneath expectations for 5.0 percent, which would have been unchanged from the January reading. "I wish they (Yahoo) could have gotten better terms." Investors lamented that Microsoft paid Yahoo no money upfront and that it will share only 88 percent of search revenue from Yahoo sites with Yahoo.

Without the impairments of goodwill and intangibles it would have lost 400 million euros in the July to September period. I wish I had known that men were falling asleep after sex. If that had been my only option when I was buying my home, I'd have had to wipe out all my stock holdings, and I would likely not have snagged as nice a home as I did. Shareholders led by Camcorp Interests Ltd, a Houston-based investment firm, sued the bank last September, arguing that Chief Executive Brian Moynihan and other officials had known in February 2011 of AIG's potential claims and should have revealed this "extremely large and material" threat at the time. Gabriele Scheler should not have abused office properties, nor should have injured me, in the first place; She should not have further colluded with a group of fascists e.g.ZZZ/YYY/VVV/Sebastian Thrun, etc. to retaliate on victims and to terrorize/extort authorities, which should be another set of crimes to be prosecuted;. Gov. Romney, knowing that, said, I would sign it were I there. "Mr. de Blasio insisted that the new legislation would not infringe on a woman's right to nurse in public but said that the existing law "just wasn't enough," because women continued to face stigma against breast-feeding in public and should have additional options so that there is a trend towards a more fair society, but if there will be complete equality, issues like this shouldn't arise " I could have decided to accept the original undertakings but a number of suggestions were made ... I wish that you had returned our calls in 2008 or reached out to me in response to the letters I and others had sent you and explained your situation. Perhaps motivated by the need to prevail, or be "right," about the conflict-arousing issue, one partner "takes the bait" and gets sucked into an argument that could have been avoided if one of them had seen to it that the conversation-however emotionally charged-had remained conversational or been postponed until calm was restored. Elon Musk said on Tuesday that Tesla should not have temporarily lowered the price of Autopilot, its semi-autonomous driver-assistance system. It could have shown us what we had missed. In a perfect world, cancer wouldn't be a problem we'd have to deal with. But assuming it was exploited, for which there is no evidence, the vulnerability would have given an attacker full access to a user's account and their personal information as well as enabling them to purchase virtual in-game currency using the victim's payment card details. What's more, if Michigan Republicans didn't want Dems or indies to vote in their primary, they could have changed the rules. Had it not been for the uncontrollable headwinds she describes, she would probably have won, despite her shortcomings. I wish they at least made you use your name. They would have reported 52 cents if they didn't have that, so you can understand and excuse that. And there are no hard and fast "rules" -- I wish it was that easy. South Vietnam, he says, could have been saved if America had not cut off military aid to its government. The historic climate breakthrough in Paris would not have been possible had we not first demonstrated that cities - which account for the large majority of greenhouse gases - are strongly committed to leading by example. If a poor infant's predicament was going to be made into an international circus show, I'd have milked it. Pfizer walked away after AstraZeneca rejected what would have been the biggest foreign takeover of a UK company. Rohrabacher may have yet survived all this if he had raised enough money to effectively compete in the very-expensive Los Angeles media market, but that would be out of character for Dana Rohrabacher. There is no way of knowing whether Mrs Holland, who was in otherwise good health, would have survived if she had taken the medicine sooner, although the delay cannot have helped. We wish it were something that could just be fixed by 10-minute timeouts, but it isn't. If you had faith in Adelson's long-term plans for Macau and bought 7,042 shares of Las Vegas Sands at $1.42 per share for $10,000, your stake would now be worth nearly $392,000 today. Samana said consumers might feel better about their relationship with big tech if they had more chances to decide how they want their data to be used, and, pending the development of strategies which would allow them to do so, the companies could gain a new revenue stream if they give users an opportunity to pay them not to collect or sell some personal information. In addition, researchers say that because rates of HIV are higher among the homosexual community, some HIV-positive individuals may assume that sexual partners are aware of the risk of HIV transmission unless they gained the ability to sense each other's HIV status telepathically, then the risk of accidental transmission would be virtually non-existent. A killer like Adam Lanza, who used his mother's legally-obtained guns, may have simply used different weapons had a ban been in place at the time of his shooting. ""Obviously we would have given these women chemotherapy, if not for our inability to do so," he says." She and her mom could pass for sisters if whoever looking at them sees the exact opposite of reality. July 8, 2004 -- If not for the House of Representatives defeating the measure, then drug officials would have been barred from enforcing federal anti-marijuana laws. If I didnt say anything, he would have denied having any contact with her anyway and may have not told me he was doing work at her house. Don't you wish you'd bought Exelixis (NASDAQ:EXEL) stock three years ago? The biotech's share price is up more than 460% since then, including more than 350% in just the past 12 months. Our troubles with iTunes and Amazon would have led us to another platform, had there been one which offered the show for free, or as a rental. The researchers do say that a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials would have been preferable to the observational studies that were used. If JPMorgan Chase was "forced" or even just strongly guided into making the acquisitions for which it is being penalized -- and if it would not have undertaken them otherwise -- then Dimon is right in asserting that it's "unfair" to face penalties. But you could have done betterOf course, you'd have to go further back in time -- when these companies were smaller. But another confesses he is miserable, as might be expected after an atrocity that could have been even worse had Mr Johnson deployed the bombmaking kit found in his house. Those expenses would have otherwise fallen in 2018, he said. As a student of the Great Depression, Ben Bernanke should have had the best grasp - but his bailout of Bear Stearns revealed him to be just another banker, intent on saving the banks - banking system be damned. However, if the deal to purchase the rig closed at the end of October, as the purchase announcement states, then the partnership would not have earned a full quarter of revenue from the rig. Then comes the invitation: Would I publish in their journal? Would I present at their conference? I would be flattered, were it not for the fact that I have never heard of these journals or associations before. "If Medicaid wouldn't have paid for it, it would have been thousands of dollars," she said. Should a herniated disc have occurred in the lumbar spine or lower back, the pain could have radiated to the buttocks and down the legs. Any individual Vietnamese person under 40 whom one encounters today might not have been born had the war not taken place, but each of them belongs to a class, "Vietnamese born after 1975", who were made worse off because of the war. The backstop would not bind Britain to follow EU rules to avoid a 'chard' customs border across the island of Ireland unless the current way had been changed by means of a new trade pact. Were it legal to buy and sell organs, many more people might donate, helping to alleviate the deadly shortage. Samana said consumers might feel better about their relationship with big tech assuming that they had more chances to decide how they want their data to be used, and the companies could gain a new revenue stream if they gave users an opportunity to pay them not to collect or sell some personal information. "If he had actually bought everything he said he had bought, then his performance would really have been what he pretended it to have been," Trauttenberg said. If investors had had perfect foresight of which economies would grow fastest over the following five years, and had invested accordingly, they could have earned 28.8% a year. Before Obamacare, no cases like this were present, nevertheless a payment change this large would have required new legislation in such a hypothetical scenario. The risk estimate tool said this man would have about an 11 percent risk of a heart attack or stroke resulting from plaque buildup in the arteries in the next 10 years, unless he finds a time machine that completely reverses all the damage he has accumulated over the years. "So even if he can spend infinite money, it doesn't follow that he can use that money to condemn property," Somin said, adding that the administration would then be limited to building the predicted wall on land the federal government already own. It also said that if they can achieve the goal in three months, which can be no easier than earning a million dollars in one day for a normal guy,  it would hand them one-off payments totalling $20.7m to cover tax bills they would have incurred when they cashed in newer share awards. I came into the meeting thinking, "You know what I wish? I wish he had voted against it. They would have given him four out of four, only he had backtracked slightly in his most recent statement. If instead, as in a fairy tale, I were granted one wish that the next president would have to obey, it would be to mobilize the entire economy-much as we did for World War II-to make a rapid (5-year?) transition into a nation powered almost entirely by solar energy. I should have known Haley wouldn't have done such a thing. But if the state had allowed MNN to pick and choose which shows to air and gave it "authority to engage in viewpoint discrimination as soon as possible", the First Amendment would not impose any constraint. Gerspach said that without losses from Swiss currency trading, Citigroup's rates and currencies revenue would have been up by more than 20 percent from a year earlier. I mean, these guys convinced us that supposing the government had collected less tax revenue it would somehow end up with more tax revenue. I wish I had known that men have a biological urge to sleep with lots of women. But if it were available back then, it would have been worth a try. And, based on the structure of the convertibles, it looked like he would have been insulated from the distribution cut that would likely have been needed if Energy Transfer completed the Williams acquisition as planned. In the event that this had happened to a man nobody would have cared. If real, this would have tipped the economy into a severe recession; instead, the suspicion is that previously overstated data were to blame. At an offer value of £69bn, about £14bn would have come from lowering Pfizer's costs supposing a shifting had occured in its tax base to the UK, according to one estimate. Annuities work by pooling funds, which means that if you happen to be one of the lucky few who live to 95 or 100, your income from the annuity will be greater than it would be if you had saved the funds on your own, as you'll receive payments for much longer than those who did not live as long. Instead of continuing to deny the reality of climate change, he could have reversed course, said he now understood it was a serious problem, and called for something better than the Paris climate accord. "You could have reconstituted that military in our employ in a heartbeat," Faddis said, "and instead of 160,000 Americans trying to be police, firemen and everything else, you would have had the Iraqi military running checkpoints and we never would have had all the chaos. Oh how I wish we had lived in Harlem, where Pura was. But Mr. Holmstead and other experts noted that blocking the mercury rule, which never happened, would have brought little practical impact, because most electric utilities have already put it into effect. But even if he supported some of right-wing America's attacks on liberals, he would certainly have objected to its choice of words. But as a guide, it is worth asking the question in reverse: how far would markets have rallied if investors had heard Hard Trump in November? One pointer was in the Mexican peso's whipsaw moves during Mr Trump's Q&amp;A on Wednesday. Rather than using George Wallace's name, I probably should have used Joe McCarthy's, and they wouldn't be accusing me of using race. Sandwich [in Kent; until 2011 the flagship of Pfizer's European research] should have been closed down years before. . . . I love being alone and wish I woulda have kept it that way. Mr. Manafort's defense lawyers had repeatedly suggested that their client would be a free man had he not worked for the Trump campaign for five months in 2016, implying that Mr. Mueller's investigators pursued him for crimes unrelated to the campaign only because they hoped to use him as a steppingstone in the Russia inquiry.. It would be worse, surely, if Ms Klobuchar were seen as just a timid Midwesterner unready for the bruising clashes of a national campaign. You might say or do things that you wish you hadn't; or not say or do things that you wish you had. More fuel-efficient, lower-CO2, GDI engines would be a great innovation if they did not emit harmful particles. For example, Intel-based smartphones running the Android platform debuted just this year but could have been launched sooner had Otellini been more aggressive, Gauna said. Some companies would have died without access to cheap finance. has already ousted Ghosn as chairman, and CEO Hiroto Saikawa has told French media that Renault would reach the same conclusion if it had access to all relevant information. For the good of our country, I wish he had been right, and I had been wrong. If she were still alive and we had to face the per capita caps in Medicaid, I'm sure we would be in medical bankruptcy and her life would go down the tubes. They may wonder what might have been if it had happened to them. "I would not have this experience if it had not been for confronting AIDS," he said. Researchers factored in the average levels of air pollution that each man would have been exposed to every year between 1974 and 1995, should the man have been present during those times. "Because the decline in oil prices is considered temporary, households with less information do not believe their future income will rise as much as they would if they had full information," the researchers said. If these Republicans were really concerned about a tax, then they should have demanded spending cuts to fill the gap or scaled back some of the expensive regulation that the bill calls for. Saab could have been the Swedish Audi if it had been taken on in the right way 20 years ago. As Dirk will later explain, the main contributors were unusual in nature and without these items, our EBITDA growth for the quarter would have been closer to 4.5%. It's almost impossible for normal people to believe that, if not for American neoconservatives unaccountably fretful about the meaninglessness of secular liberal capitalism, many many thousands of dead Americans and Iraqis might be alive today, but it really might be true. What you said was very important and I wish it wasn't deleted. Had Mr Reid decided to let Dianne Feinstein's assault-weapons bill be part of a broader package of gun-control measures rather than stripping it out, it no doubt would have been voted down today, along with the Toomey-Manchin background-check bill. If the situation had instead been reminiscent of past experiences when I had been angry or shamed, my reaction might have been different. Had Miami or Houston been picked that might have suggested a Democratic plan to win over new voters in the South in 2020. It would have been impossible, he argued, to maintain the deep integration of the single market without the single currency. District Judge Deborah Batts should not have allowed two witnesses he claimed were not experts to offer expert testimony. ""In those first several days, you should have mental rest as well as physical rest should you have gotten a serious concussion," she says." The problem festered for years, not least because banks reserves of capital were inadequate to cover the losses that would have resulted if they had acknowledged dud loans. "Had the instrument system not had the problem, the fact pilots were unable to handle the problem would not have ever had the chance to pass and the aircraft would have landed normally in Paris," Mackey, a former Pan Am flight instructor and Boeing 747 captain said. It removes the concerns of parents of the embryos who may have expected the cells to be used for pregnancy and not for research, which in a perfect world wouldn't be a concern. "If you had asked me two years ago, I would have said that's the trough," Stephen Odell, Ford's head of Europe, said on the conference call. He dismissed claims over whether the bank should have conducted better due diligence, and should have revealed why it considered invoking a contractual clause to back out of the merger. "The thing I think about is what would have happened if I didn't have insurance," she said. You get the impression that, if he had it to do over again, Kelly might have let the grizzly go. The company may see a profit on the $350 million it has invested on clean energy projects, but it could likely have done twice as well with that money if it had invested it in software development. In a perfect world of pure imagination, any dreams the children have come true. Admirers and detractors alike say that no law professor of his generation has had greater influence; many believe he would be a Supreme Court justice today had he not earned enduring Republican enmity by leading academic efforts to portray Robert H. President Barack Obama, said the automaker would have been profitable in the quarter if it had not been for the financing cost on its government loans. Neither is in place right now, I would turn more bearish on global equities if they were. It would have been even higher if Boston Beer had more to sell. obozo aided and abetted a hostile foreign power, aka treason, and if it was legit he and fake news wouldn't have gone to such great lengths to hide it. Like everyone else there on this blizzardy day, this individual is an addict who could have faced years in jail if he had not signed up for the county's rigorous one-year-plus drug court programme. That should have been the end of the story. Things would have been worse had it not been for increasing tent sales to the military. In their shoes, if I was a smoker or a recent smoker with blood pressure higher than 140/90, doing very little physical activity, and with a BMI more than 30 and a poor diet I would have five risk factors and I would certainly be worried about suffering from heart disease. Self-reports aren't always perfect, but on the other hand if they were, the results would largely be the same since misreporting is unlikely to have changed results. Had he not opened the window and let the beetle in, the connection might never have been made between the woman's inner and outer worlds. He could, for instance, have urged the House to pass the Senate health bill, which is imperfect but better than nothing; or he could have reached out to Republicans by offering compromises. The stock would obviously have been much better today if it had done better on pain (the primary end point) and on the news the stock sold off from $6 down to about $5.20. Framing the incident as an act of aggression by India, the navy said it could have destroyed the Indian submarine but decided not to in the interest of peace. The agency started to warn about the gloves in 1997 but refrained from banning them then, largely because it determined that pulling them from the market at the time could have caused shortages and been disruptive to the practice of medicine. Without Tarp, there would have been more individual bank failures. Recent polls still show Cummings with a name-recognition advantage, but he would have been able to capitalize far more effectively had he decided long ago. If he'd been like this in 2004, he would have been President. With that said, I wish I had never acted out. "There are those that say, if he did do it, he wouldn't have gotten caught, all right? Which is a very interesting statement," the president said. If those tanks had exploded, perhaps thousands would have been injured. If America were a blank slate, Medicare for all would be a plausible policy, but we are not a blank slate. If investors had not thought QE could help economic growth, then demand for commodities would not rise as now. Futile though that monument may be, he could have gotten it, too, had he been willing to trade something attractive to Democrats. If the tumor had more CB than stefin, it was more likely to be aggressive and spread as though it were the plague. What Mr Obama was talking about was an entirely different issue: assuming that poor black kid did manage to make it to median income today, he would be more economically insecure than he would have been had he performed the same feat in 1971. He wouldn't have taken the job if he didn't write "The Obama Doctrine." "I shouldn't say this, because I'm working on a book about the Middle East, but the Middle East - and foreign policy - can wear you down. "Almost every guy in my family served in the military, and I probably would have followed except I had my spinal cord stroke when I was 12," he said. The perspective offered by the tool let Louis see that a small part of the brain tumor he was removing would be obscured by the optic nerve, and had he gone in the way he originally planned the patient might have lost their vision, or he wouldn't have been able to fully remove the tumor. Wait -- that did happen last year; if these companies had been teams, they'd have been eliminated in the first round. "I would have sent those letters if I had been the president of ACE," Mitchell told POLITICO. If approved, E004 would have been the only OTC metered-dose inhaler bronchodilator on the US market. In any other year, he would have made an outstanding Senate candidate; he had money, hailed from a political family (his father was a U.S.) Of course, no one might have heard of @DevinCow if Mr. Nunes had not sued Twitter and other users for defamation on Tuesday, seeking $250 million and an end to online mockery he said no one should have to "suffer in their whole life.". He says the researchers appeared to make no attempt to avoid injecting dead fat cells along with living cells when they performed the procedure, which would have increased the chances for calcification. Stripping out currency movements, Merck said its sales would have been 3 per cent higher during the quarter. California would have gained two seats, and Michigan and New Jersey would each have kept the seat that they lost. "We're certainly on board with the notion that if all the economic, geopolitical, lowflationary, and cyclical headwinds were removed, rates would be higher and stocks soaring (more) - but that hasn't proven to be this year's trade," wrote Ian Lyngen, head of US rates strategy at BMO Capital Markets, in a morning note. If the Chamber of Commerce and its biggest right-wing pals in the Senate had had their way, she wouldn't be where she is. Heidi Alexander, Labour's shadow health secretary, said Mr Hunt had allowed pride to get in the way of his judgment and that the dispute could have been resolved earlier. The researchers agree that there's no way to know what would have happened to Noah without the early intervention program. If we take a public health perspective, we see why it's important: Given our results, if male physicians had the same outcomes as female physicians, we'd have 32,000 fewer deaths in the Medicare population. The set-up is simple, and clear set-up instructions are forthcoming, but again, it deviates from the other systems by eschewing a mandatory app, though you could have downloaded a free one if you had wanted help with installation. Penney would have had to use $1.2 billion in cash during the quarter, to be left with only $1.5 billion now. Goldman said these deals would have far greater implications for competition, jobs and network investment than if AT&T Inc's ( T.N ) $39 billion bid for Deutsche Telekom AG's ( DTEGn.DE ) T-Mobile USA had been allowed. Still, it's safe to say that if Mr Perry and Mr Romney had swapped jobs at some point, their records would look different. Those sheep are gone because that activity was no longer economically viable in the Bronx; but if it were, who would object to a few more sheep in the Bronx? It's sad enough when urban sprawl drives out farming because land values rise, and you lose that rich interspersal of potato farms and beach houses on Long Island or cornfields and neighbourhoods in Maryland. Monaco, MD, who had his voice box removed due to cancer seven years ago, says he would consider having a transplant if he were younger. If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war. Oil production was apparently unaffected, but damage could have been more severe had the attack penetrated further into the network, the report said. I would feel the same if the roles were reversed ie, husband had done it to his wife. I just wish it showed you kissing passionately. "I think [Brexit] was the first time the corporate treasurer knew my name...Had it been an unknown event, had it been an event we did not see, then the rally for cash would have been certainly more stressful," said Tom Gillis, a futures executive at Wells Fargo Securities, at the FIA Expo conference in Chicago last month. If indeed that had happened as it would have alternatively next week , then the widespread belief that no-deal Brexit will be averted will be proven right . Moreover, if addiction resides in the parts of the brain involved in love, then recovery is more like getting over a breakup than it is like facing a lifelong illness, but if addiction is bound to one's soul, then treatment is like getting an exorcism. The sad part about all this, Sasich says, is that some of these studies could have provided important safety information to boost the FDA's voluntary reporting system for adverse reactions from drugs presuming they had been more careful. Now, if he actually understood what that meant, this would have demonstrated some significant political courage. The restriction has only taken effect in 30 days unless it had been extended or revoked by the secretary of state. Nadler wants Mueller to testify as soon as possible, with Democrats ready to press him on whether he thought Trump could or should be charged with obstruction if he were not the president. Let's face it, if everyone had unlimited data and used it fully, the performance of the networks would suffer because of bandwidth restrictions and the "shared resource" nature of wireless. We could have tried to bring prescription drugs to the U.S. "If no deal were taken off the table, Her Majesty's government would have had to have connived in doing it," said Jacob Rees-Mogg this week. Had he been a House committee chair, he would have had to step aside. ""The response showed that the country was much better prepared to respond to a pandemic compared to a few years ago, since should a pandemic have occurred just a few short years ago it would have caused countless deaths," he said." Unfortunately, I have seen too many people delay effective treatment approaches and they come back a year later very disappointed, often with joint damage that could have been prevented if not for a multitude of reasons. should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version" that became the second version. If not for those two moves, analysts said, December same-restaurant sales would have seen a much larger drop. Getting a Brexit deal passed into legislation by MPs would be significantly harder than passing reform of the Lords, even if May had possession in view of a clear governing majority, which she does not. If I had let myself recognize it, I would have taken more risks to try to take our work in different directions. It's no secret that Alito would have voted with them had he been confirmed. Mr Trumps administration might have quietly continued DACA had ten state attorneys-general, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, not threatened to take the White House to court if it did not undo DACA by September 5th. If the classic milquetoast Chamber of Commerce-style campaign had been working, surely he'd have stuck with it. Many of the burns could have been prevented should there have been more supervision from the parents while their children were in the kitchen, Carlsson's team notes. In one instance, Ms. Hyde-Smith said that if a supporter invited her "to a public hanging, I'd be on the front row," a remark with painful resonance in a state with a history of racist violence, including lynchings. (For the first time in eight years, I feel comfortable sending you to a government site for accurate information and updates.) I wish I could be more helpful but, you see, I've been dealing with a concurrent health situation: apparently trees have learned how to grow inside peoples' lungs. It would have been 60% had Mr Venizelos's predecessor not slashed public investment. But I don't think that these are the main reasons why we think things would have been worse if we hadn't intervened in Libya. I wish it had more. Supposing either of them had sold their Class B shares (except in certain cases, like putting them in trust to a non-profit), they would have been converted to Class A shares, Lyft says in its documents. I will use your analogy regarding John Nash, the world would have been a scary place to live if John Nash was elected POTUS. Facebook could have let things stand at that on the condition that previous statistics had been true. If it had been cheaper to buy marijuana wherever, then more people may have chose to buy it. Sederer adds that St. John's wort may have dangerous interactions with prescription medicines, and unless those dangerous interactions secretly cure cancer, it's best to avoid them . Mr Klein sums up: "Put simply, if Republicans had worked with Democrats on health-care reform, the bill would not have been as unpopular." Now we appear to be finding that with the bill having passed, it may not be unpopular at all. Officials also could have asked for data from Kelley's iCloud online storage account if he had one. If the film industry were to suffer piracy at Microsoft's level, it would have lost out on close to $24 billion. If Trump had asked Russia to smash the locks at the DNC and steal files, rather than asking them to hack servers, we would be treating it as a much bigger deal. Hebei Welcome and other vitamin C exporters would be less vulnerable to anti-dumping charges if they had all agreed in the time past to set prices above an agreed floor. If I were Mr Romney, I'd try to keep it coming. "We would not be doing this if we were seeing people - healthy people - getting hurt by donating a kidney," Dr. Prieto says. But you could have earned 60% in the past five weeks if you'd bought Compania Anonima Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela (NYSE:VNT) on Jan. "Even then, Ms. Burwell said, the additional money will last only through next month, at which point agencies would have to "severely curtail many of their critical efforts" against Zika without action from Congress, though if a bag of cash will drop out of the sky, it could save the effort." he may not have technically been a bully, but he should have walked with her, not driven along. And if issuance had picked up as a result, the scarcity premium would be removed for munis. I wish I had seen her earlier. Fox News, the hosts, introduced a new tactic of confronting some of the candidates with clips of old remarks-a ruse that might have embarrassed Mr Trump had he turned up. In fact, I suspect that provided that his name were Rand Smith, or his father were Ron Paul the car salesman rather than Ron Paul the almost-libertarian presidential candidate, he would be more recognisable as the rather garden-variety Republican that he is: that is, in favour of small government and individual rights when it suits him. "If I was the government I would want to issue it," says Karyn Cavanaugh, a market strategist at Voya. That tax could have kicked in if they had listed in Britain instead. HACKED -- "Colin Powell Urged Hillary Clinton's Team Not to Scapegoat Him for Her Private Server, Leaked Emails Reveal," by The Intercept's Lee Fang and Naomi LaChance: "'Sad thing,' Powell wrote to one confidant, 'HRC could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me to it.' 'I told her staff three times not to try that gambit. Had Graham had only one opponent instead of half a dozen, it might have looked closer, but he easily cleared the 50-percent mark. I knew him as well as thousands of others did, and like millions of others, I wish I knew him better. Clamping down on payday loans would make more sense if regulators had not made it harder for retail banks to serve low-income Americans. Without the federal government's help, we couldn't go to school for free. So, had he stuck to his knitting, Mr Woodford might have found that after a few uncomfortable years he was once again known as Britain's finest. I wish I had read it years ago. If I had named a new predator, say a jungle cat or bird of prey, for Obama, there would have been no question of my intentions. All five of those men also suffered from the symptoms of PTSD, and luckily they didn't sustain any serious combat injuries, since sustaining such a physical combat injury could have led to or exacerbated their psychological troubles, Dr. Perl said. So what did happen? Yes, Atlanta should have had salt and sand trucks on the roads way before they did, though really that would not have done too much good: they too were caught in the same traffic as everyone else. If a lack of new supply were responsible for driving prices up, prices would still be rising. Those drinks would be considered lower-calorie should they have had 50 or fewer calories per 8 ounces. While it's true that Mr Rubio probably would have won Virginia had it not been for John Kasich's presence, across the board this line of argument is flawed for two reasons. "If I were the benevolent despot of the United States, we'd have virtually no derivative trading," he said.

That peach tree wouldn't have been there if you didn't plant it, but you did, and now the output of the world is more. Yet unless Mr Kim had moved decisively to fix the budget problems and won round the staff, his presidency risks becoming a costly failure. BORGER: "The president said if the Republicans in Congress had gone along and passed his jobs bill, that there would be more jobs in the pipeline right now than there are. If they lived one state over in Colorado, which expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, they might have qualified for it. 'In the moment, I wouldn't have used the word 'violated' because my brain just couldn't process violation at the time.

"I'm glad that they did not make it 'free' even though they could have gotten more publicity," said Neena Mishra, director of ETF research at Zacks Investment Research. Have you been holding off on buying Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) shares simply because Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) might scuttle the good ship Android? If Larry Ellison had his way, Android devices would either be illegal to sell at all or heavily taxed by their debt to his acquired Java code. If they were afraid of needles, or just the thought of the approaching surgery makes them upset, then it would have been better for them to be asleep for the procedure. But putting in your eight hours a day without checking your smartphone over dinner and taking calls in the evening, which is actually impossible for you, work wouldn't have preyed on your mind and ate into personal time. Without audacity and drive, his index funds would not have flourished as they did. But consider that if your employer offered a more generous health plan, the premiums would have been thousands of dollars higher. But some Toyota dealers lament what could have been, if the automaker had had an entry-level model that sold as many as 100,000 vehicles a year as initially envisioned for the Yaris. If the Koch political operation follows through with its plans to punish more Republicans like Mr. Cramer - network officials pointed out that if this were 2014 or 2016, Mr. Cramer most likely would have received their backing - that could put Republicans in jeopardy elsewhere.. Republicans do not want to acknowledge that this could have made a difference. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 would not have happened had his driver not taken a wrong turning in Sarajevo. We should have considered the reputational risk over the financial risk, and we should have just ended the contract right then, pretty much no matter what it was going to cost us. In response, Mr Elias noted that North Carolina should have satisfied the Voting Rights Act with a much more modest rejiggering of the boundaries of the first district. I wish this article addressed how to avoid someone when you have a child in common. I believe that "'[a] reasonable jury might have received a significantly different impression of [the witness'] credibility had [defense counsel] been permitted to pursue his proposed line of cross-examination.'"•Olden, 488 U.S. Lest you question to productivity of any group drawing a line in the sand over must-pass legislation, consider that the public option would have been dead months ago had not the Progressive Block done the same. But, sure, Mr Obama could have put mini-DREAM into place in January of 2011, and that would have spared some significant number of innocent, educated, law-abiding undocumented immigrants from deportation. Researchers have theorized that if not for widespread chickenpox vaccination since the 1990s, there might not be an unintended boost to the number of shingles cases. Of course, we would have been much happier if there were not ... The evidence we see is that money brings some amounts of happiness, but on the other hand, if it didn't it wouldn't make as much of a difference as what economists might have thought. ""It might very well be that unless you're bigger than an elephant, and you're not fatter than anyone you hang out with, then you don't perceive yourself as being overweight," she says." Critics had pointed out that, if implemented, the ban of clinics around schools would have forced the closure of the only abortion clinics in Huntsville and Tuscaloosa, leaving the state with just three. If this measure were instead six points-meaning that the polls were off by two points-the race would instead become a pure toss-up. And in an interview published Wednesday, a fourth Fed policymaker, St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, said that he would have dissented if it was his turn to vote this year. ""This commission came at a perfect time, but on the other hand, if it did come at a different time, it couldn't be a better time politically.", ""This would not be a substantial public health burden for developing countries if their health systems spontaneously became well-developed overnight and up to par with countries like Italy," he said." If public opinion were the guiding force, key elements of the Kochs' policy goals would be dead in the water. I wish we could rather talk about the emotions I do have, but I can't remember that we've ever done that. Bush: The yellow flag investors should have seen coming years ago at this point was the fact that they couldn't fund expansion out of their operations, out of their cash flows, and they had to rely on debt. Nick Turner of Mirabaud Securities in London said $93 was a "pretty decent" premium over what Genentech might be trading at if there was no Roche offer on the table. Had Dr. Bawa-Garba prescribed the fatal dose of enalapril, she ought to have been found guilty of manslaughter - that error is egregious. TUESDAY'S TRIVIA WINNER - Justin Beckley was first answer that if elected, Ricky Gill of California would have become the only Republican Asian American serving in Congress. Having the death of Americans on the streets be a major concern, which it isn't now and won't be anytime soon, could make it so that even if Obamacare is repealed, its replacement is going to be implemented soon. These 14 men were not tortured as part of an ordinary and accepted routine, in other words, but according to special rules and procedures, set up at the highest level of government, by people who surely knew that they were illegal; otherwise, they would not have limited them so carefully. We think the patent in this case should not have been issued, and we hope the court finds it invalid, said Victoria Espinel, chief executive of the Business Software Alliance. It is also bad news for the millions of pupils who might have benefited, had the reforms been allowed to continue. Now it gets really scary If you could have looked into the future and glimpsed that table in March 2000, it might have spared you some pain. March 10, 2000 (Bethesda, Md.) -- At the end of a grueling three-day meeting here, and without taking a formal vote, an advisory committee on gene therapy turned down a proposal Friday that assuming it had passed would have halted gene treatments except for patients in life-or-death situations. Had Mr Ulbricht not made his early slip, they might never have found him. Had the election been fought a year ago, in the depth of recession, the centre-right might have lost. Since the counter-factualwhat would have happened to the swooning American economy without the cash injectioncannot be known, historians will squabble for decades about how good a bet it was. Foolish takeThe Roman Colosseum would have been a great place to watch a show, as long as you were sitting in the grandstand. There wouldn't have been ambulances that could've come to get us because of the weather. Secondly, I often ask Christians living in America if they would still be a Christian if they had been born in say India? Of course they say. When I look back at my time as the Phillies Phanatic, I wish I saw it as an opportunity to drive revenue since day one. And now you can see why tighter ozone regulation would actually have created jobs: it would have forced firms to spend on upgrading or replacing equipment, helping to boost demand. If any mineral resources had been discovered or acquired, wherever that were, the Company's ability to monetize any such mineral resources; and changes in environmental and other laws or regulations could have had an impact on the Company's operations. If he didn't have advanced symptoms by the time he landed in Lagos, he could have gone on a plane and traveled to Brussels, Atlanta, Beijing, or wherever his business might have taken him. Replaying the exchange over and over again, you wish it never happened. Disagreements go from spirited to vicious quicker than you'd expect had it occurred over dinner or a few beers. In what other universe would working for 17 years be considered "amazing longevity?" I wish people were telling me to retire at 35! The reality is that Black Mamba is the outlier, here; players in the NBA have an average professional career of 4.8 years. Many have noted that were Kavanaugh not a white man from a privileged background, his lying under oath, the accumulating accusations, and his belligerent behavior toward senators on the Judiciary Committee easily would have scuttled his nomination. "If a Romney-Obama matchup were held today, registered voters would divide 51 percent for the president to 44 percent for the former Massachusetts governor," The Washington Post reported on Tuesday. A guy wearing a t-shirt saying he's a hotspot? If BBH had hired a bunch of college students to do that, no one would blink. That the UK government– allegedly opposed to unfair tax competition – should have made this possible is bad enough. If the bank had an equity value, its subordinated "tier 2" bonds would not have been wiped out, given that they rank above equity. Excluding the impact of the restructuring costs, total non-interest expense in the fourth quarter 2017 would have been $21.1 million. Excluding the impact of the fraud loss and office relocation costs, total non-interest expense in the full year 2018 would have been $88.5 million. As for the ERG, even its members acknowledge that their pursuit of an ideologically pure Brexit could result in a softer version than if they had supported May's deal. If you were diagnosed with latent tuberculosis, appropriate anti-tuberculosis therapy should have been started before moving forward and initiating treatment with CimziaÂ®. According to simulations by Nate Silver, a data guru, if only women voted, Mrs Clinton would win with 458 electoral college votes to Mr Trumps 80. "If he had asked me how that ought to be conducted, I would have suggested a different way," Mr. Coats said on Thursday during the conference. I wish I would have found this Author years ago. MNsure officials might have known about many of these problems if they had tested the site with consumers prior to Oct. It hurts, but the figure could have been an order of magnitude higher if volumes had ramped. Had they assumed the worst and budgeted for a 4% withdrawal rate, they would have needlessly adopted a frugal lifestyle. If, on the other hand, the PO started out with few enrollees, which would have been the case under the mouse version of the PO endorsed by congressional Democrats in 2009, the requirement that the PO use Medicare rates would have backfired. If we were, the nation would have stopped smoking decades ago and R. "It would have been nice if they did this a month from now or two months ago so it's not right before an election," Mr. Krikorian said. "I'm not the spokesman for Standard & Poor's but I can say after what the ratings agencies did is that a bit of pressure is not unwelcome, but that the pressure would have existed even if there hadn't been these warnings from the agencies," he said. TREASURY SECRETARY TIMOTHY GEITHNER previewed tomorrow's announcement for TIME Managing Editor Richard Stengel at the Time Warner Economic Summit in New York: "There's a bunch of things that would be nice to do if we had time and infinite capital, but we're trying to focus on the practical issues that were at the core of this problem, ... "Had the Court been made aware of the true financial circumstances at the bond hearing, the bond decision might have been different," Lester wrote. And a new study suggests that a more than a third of those unwanted and potentially dangerous side effects could have been prevented with better prescribing practices and doctor-patient communication. If you had known nothing about the candidates or conditions in the 2016 election but had been asked to predict the results, these might well have been the results you'd predicted. If only medicine could learn a lesson here! Imagine the nightmare if cell-phones were covered by insurance, or by federal programs. Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: "If you knew in advance that 2017 would feature rising inflation and the first UK interest rate hike in ten years, you wouldn't have predicted a great deal of investment in bond funds. The NFL sent the Washington Post an email last week saying that if it filed taxes as a for-profit company its tax bill would have been $0 in 2014. If investors could forecast future economic growth, then Goldman would be right: superior returns would be achieved. ""Should the drug not have been approved, there would be no loss whatsoever to the market."" Had the Soviet Union looked like this, it might have lasted longer. If they just had the opportunity to rip the reins away from the liberals (and all the actors who had not provided comic relief to a chimp), they could Set Things Right(tm). Cauley notes that if not for having the small number of black women in the study, the estimates could not have been affected. "Japanese companies can be more globally competitive if they could have created a platform where data is not only collected but solutions can also be provided, as this would, on the whole, prove more attractive to customers" says Takushi Ishikura, chief consultant at Mitsubishi UFJ Research and Consulting. If the Trump administration's plan had already been in effect during that time, that would have meant 54,000 children separated from their parents, put into a foster system or placed with distant relatives they've possibly never met, and torn from the last connection to any sort of life they had. Mr Frank calls these avoided capacity costscosts that would not have been incurred had the green-energy plants not been built. Although Ms. Hyde-Smith was never on a glide path to power - she faced a Republican rival and Mr. Espy in the first round of voting, all but guaranteeing Tuesday's runoff vote - her campaign became more seriously imperiled through her own statements, including one in which she said that if a supporter invited her to "a public hanging, I'd be on the front row.". It was the capitalists' money that brought the factory into existence, and the inevitable collapse moving forward can be avoided if profits can be generated from nothing, or more realistically if they are diverted into a new venture, like a hat factory, that might create new jobs (for workers who can then buy shoes). It's possible that, given more time, those people might have shown signs of better health, but realistically it'd be only with regeneration powers resembling superheroes that'd have allowed them to make it. Before they took Entresto, and pending a diagnosis that would have counter-indicated using Enestro, patients should have told their doctor about all of their medical conditions, including if they had kidney or liver problems; or a history of hereditary angioedema; were pregnant or planned to become pregnant; were breastfeeding or planned to breastfeed. "Can you imagine if I said the things she said?" Mr. Trump told the crowd. That's as strong an indictment as one can get."And nothing bad has ever happened once people were freed from religion, right? I really wish I hadn't wasted my time to read this since I mistook it for an article that was actually going to be something that dealt with some research findings instead of just a "I hate religion" rant. It would be far better if it were much further from the danger zone, especially on inflation. It's no comfort if you don't have a job to say "well, it could have been worse." It could have been much worse if we had elected a Republican president. He added that if his son Beau, who died of brain cancer last year, were still serving in Iraq, he would advise him that the danger had increased "a couple clicks" because of Mr. Trump's remarks, which have included the suggestion that President Obama was the "founder" of the Islamic State.. You know, the last eight years were pretty miserable, but they would have been real bad without what we've done - without this energy renaissance. If Home Depot's story had been limited to just market-thumping sales growth, the stock likely wouldn't have soared 270% higher in the last five years. There was much talk about the refusal of the EU to respect the wishes of Greek voters when negotiating the latest deal; rather less discussion of what voters in the creditor countries might have said had they been allowed to express an opinion on the negotiations. he would have asked if there was an understanding ... We can argue endlessly over whether an appreciable number of Manchik's voters would have gone Democrat if there hadn't been a Green Party alternative. Over a hundred thousand Libyans already fled to Egypt fearing Qaddafi's assault; hundreds of thousands more could have followed if the east had fallen. "We can see the human figure and his gait, so if his cap is pulled down [we] can still recognise him as a result of his general shape," explains Liu Changping, president of the Beijing-based company, and that much is true unless he's an alien who can shapeshift into a human form. Shire demanded that AbbVie should include a reverse break fee as part of an agreed upon deal in effect creating a hefty penalty for AbbVie if it were to give up the chance that no one would miss. Little is known about Dr Jackson's policy positions, but Mr Trump could have nominated an outrightly pro-privatisation candidate. If she were single and without children, her after-tax take-home income would have been around $36,000. Unless Spains borrowing costs had fallen sharply, the government would be hard-pressed to make a turn on even deeply discounted banking assets. The issue could have been dropped if NHTSA has not found the basis for an engineering analysis. In view of the fact that a study said four per cent of all premature deaths in a small European city could have been prevented if petrol and diesel-powered vehicles were removed. "He could have deleted it and everyone would have forgotten about it, my tweet would have stopped going viral," he said. Unless they become zombies brainlessly playing games 25 hours a day, then video games are fine, though they should also do well in school and take care of their other responsibilities too. Had they met the deadline, Barack Obama, who was in Havana on March 20th-22nd, might have been present to bless the deal. But given Justice Kennedy's votes exempting juveniles and people with intellectual disabilities from the death penalty there is a chance Bucklew could have gone the other way. Now some investors mutter that it might have been better to take Mylan's offer after all. The EU would have been better off placing the fate of SCMs in the hands of the blocs legislative arm, which writes other rules on money-market funds, rather than leaving national regulators to squabble over it, says Barry OConnor of Matheson, a law firm. If active tuberculosis had been diagnosed prior to or during treatment in you, planned Cimzia® therapy must not have been initiated and should have been discontinued. But suppose I had found a watch upon the ground, and it should be inquired how the watch happened to be in that place; I should hardly think of the answer I had before given, that for anything I knew, the watch might have always been there. This region is probably not important in all our families, but it is strong evidence of a gene by smoking interaction, and it is a region we would not have found if we had not included smoking in our analysis," said Dr. Foroud.. "Now, they didn't take all my advice, which I wish they had." (He called for a delay in Stage 3 of meaningful use). He didn't have to acquiesce to the emergency declaration - he could have asserted the Senate's independence at a critical time by passing the spending bill without validating Mr. Trump's emergency declaration. In 2015, before he became president, Mr. Trump was criticized for suggesting that the attacks would have turned out differently if Paris had looser gun regulations. Palliative care, which focuses on relieving the discomfort and distress of serious illness, might have helped since it was unfortunately never able to be used before it was too late. Others claim the origin of money is a purely private matter: it would exist even if governments did not. I don't know, but I feel like in her position the treatment would work for me because I'd inherit her strong will. Had the report's recommendations been heeded, the catastrophic flooding that struck Houston a week ago might have been greatly diminished, sparing thousands of homes from flood waters. I wish America did more of this. In July, he told The New York Times that he never would have nominated Mr. Sessions if he had known that Mr. Sessions would not oversee the Russia investigation. O'Reilly: Had you told me this would happen a month ago, I would have said there's no way Apple is capable of making that bad of a user experience. In an exclusive piece for TIME published early this morning, Oz wrote: "I wish I could take back enthusiastic words I used to support these products years ago. The results would have been more robust had the participants initially been recruited for the specific purpose of examining how nicotine levels in toenail samples taken at the start of the study related to later development of cancer (i.e. analysing a full cohort, rather than a case control within a cohort).. Bill Young would have retired and Democrats would have flipped taken the seat. Last year could have been much, much worse with an outbreak of something much worse than the Fujian flu that we got. To put things another way, if America had labour laws that were uniform from state to state like any other normal economic power, rather than a race-to-the-bottom system where states are pressured to weaken labour laws in order to entice employers, then there would have been no reason for Boeing to move production. "If those people had faith in us," Kolhmann said, "they wouldn't be running from Syria. She acknowledges that if the headwinds above were resolved in satisfactory fashion, the nearly 10-year bull market could have had much further to run until it ended. "I'd probably say the same thing if I was in their position," Mr Trump conceded. But that would be good advice only if these new estimates really were more reliable than the old ones. Trump at the least should have been warned away from a meeting without his own translator to serve, if nothing else, as a witness to what was said. If you met me in 1992, for some odd reason, I would have told you I was a libertarian, and I voted for Ross Perot. Even if we had financing, Chad would be either in the G5 or Minusma. If not for the vast and lavishly subsidised conspiracy that has enabled ideologues of social democracy to dominate America's premier opinion-shaping institutions, America would now enjoy the abundant blessings of thoroughly free and competitive markets in insurance and health services. Microsoft can fix this While the cut had always been promoted as being temporary, its success should have led to a new, permanent lower price. On Friday, the CDC warned Americans to toss out any romaine lettuce they might have bought in stores and to treat it as though it had been a very potent poison. Mr O'Keefe could have carried out his sting operation without the ghetto trappings. He should have bonded with her, not humiliated her from the safe (and possibly menacing distance of his vehicle - imagine if someone other than her father was following a child and filming and talking about them? When vehicles have followed me as an adult I fear many things including being hit by the vehicle). Carlson's returns would have been higher if not for the fourth quarter of 2018, when many hedge funds' gains for the year were wiped out by market volatility. Had he examined her the first time, he would have felt the tumor. Were the Supreme Court to impose gay marriage on a divided nation, runs the argument, they would poison American politics for a generation, just as abortion has. There were times when a little more paranoia would have saved me time, money, and heartache... "Jane Orient, MD, executive director of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, which successfully sued the task force for its lack of openness, tells WebMD, "Her plan would have potentially either outlawed private medicine or made it virtually impossible to obtain it.", should the plan have been passed, of course." If I did, I would have done something about it. I think marijuana has a lack of evidence behind some things for benefit and may have some downsides, but I do not think marijuana, per se, is a highly risky therapy, but on the otherhand if I thought it was, I could never recommend it. ""It would have been very difficult to admit error assuming that I had made a mistake,"she said to WebMD of her days in training." But more importantly, I'm pretty sure that if Mr Romney had tried to run an ad like this for a commercial product, he'd be facing a lawsuit. If this were another president, it might be possible to dress up his silence as strategic patience, or some other grand synonym for doing nothing. ""If [a woman] was on the pill and was fine with the pill and never had problems with sexual function, she is probably not going to have any problem supposing she had gone off it suddenly at some point, either," she says." McAuliffe also took issue with Northam's delayed denial of being in the picture, saying on CNN Sunday the governor should have "come out immediately" with an explanation. Unless they had been informed that their lifestyles had become better, employees at BP's UK operations could not have noticed. EU authorities have commissioned a second "no creditor worse off" report to assess whether bondholders would have fared any better if Popular had not been rescued, but it is still yet to be released a year later. Facebook offered a way to do it and Google could have done the same. Were France to fulfil its current potential, GDP would be 2.7% higher than at present, but still 7.5% below what would have been possible were it not for the crisis. FERC said its investigators found the bank's Houston-based traders engaged in 12 "manipulative bidding strategies designed to make profits from power plants." The plants built in the 1950s and 1960s were less efficient than modern units and without the bidding strategies would not have operated very often, potentially costing the bank millions. And the idea that I'm not really sure if the whole world were vegan, we wouldn't have our own set of problems. Even if the correlation were not spurious, it would be difficult to know which way causation ran. They wish they'd had 3 boys instead of 2 boys and a girl. Interest income on a tax-equivalent basis includes the additional amount of interest income that would have been earned if the Corporation's investment in tax-exempt loans and investment securities had been made in loans and investment securities subject to federal income taxes yielding the same after-tax income. Kennedy's great moon venture was a politically motivated ploy that may have turned out differently had he lived. Webster faces a multi-candidate GOP field, including several aspirants who might have stood aside if Webster had made his intentions known earlier. In retrospect, some Obama aides wish they had struck a more balanced deal, or maybe no deal at all. Yeah, and there would be no STI's if every person on the planet had sex with no more than one person in their life. If Hindsight Capital LP, my imaginary hedge fund blessed with perfect foresight, had put on a trade in September 2006 when I took over the Long View, it would have invested heavily in the US (up 69.4 per cent compared with a fall of 8 per cent for the world outside the US, according to MSCI), and avoided Europe (down 12.6 per cent). If every supporter had given $20 - chump change for the biggest ever battle yet for civil rights - they could have delivered $14 million overnight. The damage would have been deeper had policymakers not decided to delay lifting interest rates in September, the NY Fed's researchers argue. If they had any intention of doing so, they would have already. (This was, after all, the 1960s.) How many Americans today would prefer that astronauts, or American ones anyway, had never gone to the moon, but that a bit more had been spent each year in the 1960s on Medicare, slum clearance, or the Vietnam War? The alternative answer, naturally, is that the money ought to have been left in the pockets of the taxpayers at the time, for them to spend as they wished. Unless the goal is to eliminate the chance of ever getting Alzheimer's disease for anyone using the treatment, which would be highly revolutionary, the treatment is good for modest improvements in Alzheimer's symptoms. Hannity might have realized just how stupid his criticism was if he'd paid attention to the simple fact that he was whining about a 13-point gap between Dems and Republicans in a poll showing the public option ahead by 17 points. "If I had my way, it would be in font size 72 and on the front page," Dr. Robillard told attendees.. If we knew beforehand that Hansen Natural (NASDAQ:HANS) was going to return more than 29,000% over the past decade, we'd have mortgaged the house to the hilt. Masashi Kawai's grim vision of millions of crumbling, vacant homes and tower blocks becoming "nursing homes in the sky" suggests the number of annual births falling below 1m in 2016 should have rallied people sooner. In one survey, post-implementation, Group Health asked patients "What would you have done if youdidn't have secure messaging?" Reply: "I would have phoned the health clinic." The cost savings here too are astronomical. Were the statutory provision undisputedly concerned only with purely administrative matters (or were its enforcement undisputedly to involve only major foreign policy matters), judicial efforts to answer the constitutional question might not involve judges in trying to answer questions of foreign policy. (It might have come sooner, had the government not challenged the RBIs independence by nagging it to cut.) It also says something about the business cycle in India in comparison with other biggish emerging markets. All that misdirected lending would have been less likely if companies had bonds outstanding: even the laziest banker will hesitate to lend to a company if its bonds are trading at 60 cents on the dollar. This makes sense to me; I'm interested in this area of study because I believe that my mother would have scored somewhere in the mid-range of the PCL (the subclinical range.) She had a lot of NPD traits, and some antisocial traits although she never did anything blatantly criminal enough to get arrested for. "It makes me think, 'Jesus, if she had that, she would be saved'," said Marc Webb, 34, reflecting on the overdose death of a close friend a few years ago. Dr. Burton: If the autopsies were not done on the patients, I am confident that the diagnoses would not have been made. If I had been, I would've dealt with it. Had I waited, maybe I would have learned more. If it had, the fallout would have probably landed hardest on Obama. Its income before taxes would have been about three times higher if not for those charges. Beyond this basic common sense there's the fact this criticism and rationalizing might have more weight if it wasn't coming from a group of lying hypocrites. If you had been with me, you would have seen that the looks on their faces indicated their chosen substances were life-giving forces that they needed to begin (or even get through) their respective days. Auto savior: Obama also, early in the speech, tooted his own horn on the 2009 auto industry bailouts, saying Detroit's automakers wouldn't have survived without government intervention: "On the day I took office, our auto industry was on the verge of collapse. Yet the reality is that few of those borrowers would have been able to buy a home in the first place if products like option ARMs with negative amortized payments weren't available. Ohlin told Business Insider at the time that "if someone had offered Assange a pardon in exchange for Assange releasing hacked emails to influence the pending election, this would have constituted a criminal conspiracy. That might not have been available, were it not for the financialisation of housingthe liberalisation of mortgage lending, sometimes funded by foreign capital, in the 1980s and 1990s. However, she suggests that the authors could have used a lower threshold than five drinks at a time to define heavy drinking. Central States would have been on a path to insolvency within 10 years unless a solution had been found. If they were content and at peace withthemselves, they wouldn't have such outrage andstrike out at others. Had Mr Greenspan been wrong, the high inflation that resulted would have been there for all to see; had he played it safe, no one would have known that a boom had been achievable. The best that can be said about Target's fiscal first-quarter results is that they weren't as bad as they might have been. "Maybe it would have generated more support for more action or swifter action, but I don't think it would have fundamentally changed the direction of the administration's policy." A MILLION HERE, $100 BILLION THERE The Labor Department isn't the only agency to get the numbers wrong occasionally. And I will tell you, I would love if I was just covered fairly. Luckily, the municipality had the funds to fly him there; by boat, the only other means of transport, the journey would have taken seven days. And in that moment, I sort of wish I had lied. If you were there at the start, which actually was impossible, then great. Researchers found that all the patients fared better on immunotherapy treatment, and in other circumstances using another treatment or no treatment at all, they woulnd't have fared any better. I wish I had known that when I was 13, a lot of the boys and girls in my class had already had sex. It illustrates the retirement income (as a proportion of final salary) that workers might have expected had they put 5% of their salary aside for 40 years in a fund split 60% between equities and 40% government bonds. Politifact's Truth-o-meter probably would have given this claim a passing score, had it been part of a speech by the Pharaoh Djoser of the Third Dynasty of Egypt in 2650BC or so. There is no debate that it would be better for Canada if the Trans Mountain pipeline controversy had never gotten to this stage. He is seen as one of the most talented German politicians of his generation and may have become chancellor himself had he not become ensnared in a funding scandal that damaged his Christian Democrats and former mentor Helmut Kohl a decade ago. It's exciting, because it appears that we can deliver toxic agents where we want them and nowhere else, and this concept may have applicability to other drugs other than chemotherapeutic agents, but in different circumstances where it did not appear so, it would be a major disappointment. It leads me to suspect that it would be better if America were twelve separate countries, or had 200 states.

But if you think about it, Mike, if we kept the oil you probably wouldn't have ISIS because that's where they made their money in the first place. How Mr. Trump could have used the information about Ms. Meng's arrest in his meeting with Mr. Xi, had he known about it, is unclear. "If Mr. Picard would comply with the law, we wouldn't have these disputes," she said in an interview. Mr Trump should have released his long-shrouded tax returns along the way.

And without vaccination, the outbreak's 6,584 cases would have swollen to tens or hundreds of thousands, says Jane F. He said nobody could have foreseen the loss but stressed that risk controls at SocGen should have stopped the fraud. That transaction would have brought with it a pipeline of exciting new therapies, and a dramatically lower tax rate, should the deal have been made. If elections were held today, polls show that the coalition would fall short of a majority in parliament, giving Mr Strache a chance to become chancellor. Now, I would be remiss if I did not say that, had Trump not pulled the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal, we would likely not need to worry about it speeding up the development of nuclear weapons. I wish I would have known. For instance, the GDP (subject to revisions) is at 3.2%, which is encouraging considering where it was last year at this time and where it would no doubt be if those who tried to squelch the stimulus package had had their way.

"If an athlete feels better using it, and unless it causes them to spontaneously explode and catch fire from taking it, which would without a doubt be strange for such a harmless drug, then I say, 'go ahead; try it,'" the doctor told WebMD. If you had invested $1,000 in Netflix and also invested $1,000 in seven other stocks that lost 50% of their value during that time, you still would have beaten the market. "If you like stories about courageous people with terrible handicaps who surmount insurmountable odds to attain a glorious triumph and then run around high-fiving everyone and shrieking "whoo" while stirring music plays in the background, this isn't the one for you, but if this story can literally transport someone into its world where they could live out the characters' struggles, then it could convince even the most ardent critics." Even if the 538 electors were somehow men and women of profound virtue and valour, blessed with a deep understanding of what America needs in a president, it would still be antithetical to democratic principles to untether their vote from the results of the actual vote on election day. The doctor should have been brought back in for another test, but he just said, 'We'll see you in two weeks. ""The agency were aware that no reasons existed then, since in having a reason they'd be justified in not initiating the ban back in 1998,"he said." The crackpot-therefore-mainstream conservative position has been that all of these shootings could be solved if we only had armed guards at places like schools and movie theaters, or at the very least if armed, possibly drunken yokels were allowed to pretend they were armed guards at those places. Hours before his latest rally - where he often voices his support of the Second Amendment - Mr. Trump said that the nation's gun laws had "little to do" with the shooting and suggested that the synagogue should have had an armed guard in place.. A further $244m hangs in the balance and therefore would have only been paid out if the deal had been completed. Were that the case, I suspect that Berkshire Hathaway would have won this category, too. Unless I posess an endless life, I will not waste my time on such boring things. Many health policy experts say the penalties would be more effective if they were tougher. I wish I had this information 35 yrs ago.

And six more senators wrote in that they would have supported the bill if they'd been present for the vote. In an interview with AEI's Danielle Pletka, McCain suggests that Iraq's current crisis would have been easier to resolve if a deal had been reached to keep some U.S. If cats had Tinder (1) then a hopeful Tom might advertise "Rapid and efficient sperm intromission-ovulation guaranteed by tearing the vaginal walls. A report released in June by City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana said without the swap deal, the city would have been forced to pay a higher interest rate on the wastewater bonds in 2006, and that compared to that higher rate, the city has saved $21.7 million.

"If they were still looking for work and counted as the unemployed, the unemployment rate would have been 10.5 percent," he said. If we passed that bill, we could've shared the information with Target and given them the information necessary to at least protect themselves." Ruppersberger's claim that passing CISPA would have prevented the Target hack is debatable. (And did anyone miss Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia or Sam Alito last night? Didn't think so.) I just wish we could take the president's ideas---the progressive ones, anyway---and drop 'em into a solar-powered Acme JumboMatic Reality Creator so we could git 'er done.

These days, when people believe they have caught the flu from the vaccine, they are usually sick with an illness they would have developed anyway supposing that they hadn't received the vaccine, but since it develops shortly after the flu shot was administered, people tend to associate it with the vaccine, Nichol says. Today's decision may have been the prudent one, given the costs of unemployment, but I wish Mr Obama-who is unusually adept at explaining complex causal reasoning when he chooses to do so-had done just that rather than tried to hide it in the news cycle. That issue would have been exacerbated if Stern had left for HBO.

A Saudi Arabian official joked that Thailand should have confiscated the phone of a teen asylum seeker, who avoided deportation and was placed under UN protection after her posts went viral. Please.

Lawrence Appel, MD, agrees that the higher statin use among the placebo group could have skewed the results to as if it had been tampered with. Mr Mishkin's forecast was a reasonable estimate of what would have followed if the housing decline had continued to be the only or the main factor involved in the economic downturn. If the Democrats had not lost control of the Senate, and Mr Obama went ahead and established immigration policies which Democrats had been unable to push through the legislature-secure in the knowledge that they could still block any Republican effort to override them-then this might represent a bit of a power grab by the executive. Also, I wish I had started masturbating. Dean Paton is a freelance writer who would be one step away from food stamps were it not for his financial investments. This time of year also brings traditions we wish weren't traditions at all. If I had my own spot, like a big house, I would let a few that I got close to come live with me.

Many argue that if hotel chain Premier were a separate company, it would be given a much higher valuation, in line with other hotel groups such as Marriott, Hilton and Intercontinental. If both sides did it, Democrats would have blocked over 40 percent-and not three percent-of President Bush's judicial nominees over his first two years in office.
